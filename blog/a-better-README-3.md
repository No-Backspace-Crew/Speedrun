## Setting the stage (Cont'd)

### Adding variables and using JavaScript

You can add your own variables to the configuration and use JavaScript to resolve them.  Let's add a `logGroup` variable that is made up of a prefix and the stage.  We'll define it at the service level so it's available to all stages.

````
#srConfig
{
  role : "ReadOnly",
  services : {
    TicketService : {
       logGroup : "/aws/lambda/${service.toLowerCase()}-${srRegionName.substring(srRegionName.lastIndexOf('-')+2).toLowerCase()}",
       regions: {
         "us-west-2 - Prod" : {
            "account" : "11111111111"
         },
         "us-west-2 - Beta" : {
            "account" : "22222222222"
         }
       }
     }
  },
  srShowConfig: true,
  srHideUserService: true
}
```
````

Now when you pick a stage, the `logGroup` will be set to `/aws/lambda/ticketservice-prod` or `/aws/lambda/ticketservice-beta` depending on which stage you pick.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip Use the Debug tab on a block to see what the variables are currently set to.

```
#copy
//Click the Debug tab above to see all variables
${region}
${account}
${role}
${logGroup}
```

### Getting AWS credentials

If you're using AWS, the config above can get you AWS credentials in a role.  You can use `#copy.withCreds` to get command line credentials.  Maybe you want to add the commands to deploy your [CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) stack.  Notice how we override the role for this block to `Deployment` otherwise it would be set to the page config of `ReadOnly`.

```
#copy.withCreds {role:'Deployment'}
cdk deploy
```

If you instead want to federate into the AWS console, use the `#federate` template.  The toolbar gives you quick access, but if you want to go to a specific place, using the federate template and provide the console path.

```
#federate
cloudwatch/home?region=${region}#logsV2:log-groups/log-group/${encodeCloudWatchURL(logGroup)}
```

There's already a [template](https://github.com/No-Backspace-Crew/Speedrun/wiki/Templates) to do this, so you can do the same thing with `#CloudWatchLogs`:

```
#CloudWatchLogs
```
